# Simple-Notebook
This is a simple notebook which keeps track about your notes. You can have multible notebooks with multible notes in it.
This notebook should work on any OS, but I have only tested it on Linux and Windows yet. "Simple-Notebook" is a console application.

# Usage
Just compile and run the executable on the console. The menu will guide you through.
